**State Minimum Wage Analysis 
(1968 - 2020)**

By: Alex King, Steven Vo, Diego Lopez-herrera

Our analysis focused on analyzing the change in State minimum wage from 1968 to 2020, as well as how Federal Minimum wage may have impacted state policy during this time period. In order to focus on this trend, we wanted to posit 3 specific questions:

What is the trend of state minimum wage growth? How does it compare in recent years against the federal minimum wage?
How has the average Federal minimum wage affected the state's minimum wage over the years accounting for inflation??
Has regionality impacted minimum wage? What regions of the United States show the greatest and least growth in minimum wage from 1994 to 2020?
